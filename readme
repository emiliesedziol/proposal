This is the project coverted in Udemy.com Angular 2 + Rails 5 Bootcamp

To get the skeliton to work I needed to change the following line in package.json
    "start": "tsc && concurrently \"tsc -w\" \"lite-server\" ",
    "start": "concurrently \"npm run tsc:w\" \"npm run lite\" ", works
- npm start didn't work until this change was made

On the new proposal page, I haven't figured out how to get the 'Generate Proposal' to be hidden
  until the form was completely filled out.  The button is disabled until the form is filled in

  After the proposal has been generated I added reset so another proposal could be created

Proposal List I added the delete button.  Working on the project I manage to create a lot of weird proposals
    The delete button works but the reload doesn't work properly as of 10/12/17
    if the update is set to 5 seconds there isn't much notice that there is a problem
    but if the update is set to 5 minutes it is obvious
